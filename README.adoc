Adventure Planner is a Windows Desktop application for planning how to level a
character in D&D 5e.

== Keep it simple

The scope is one character class for 20 levels, with basic progression.

This means no multiclassing, no feats, and no epic levels. That stuff can be added later if it makes sense.
