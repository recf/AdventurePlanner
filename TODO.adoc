* Add PlayerName
* Add Alignment prop to UI
* :bug: Level Plan: Ability Score Improvements will throw if you try to add the
  same Ability more than once. Look into filtering available options based on
  what has already been selected. I should do the same thing for New Skill
  Proficiencies, but that shouldn't actually throw, so it's less important.
* :question: Modify ExtractSourceTodos.ps1 to read XML comments.
* For the expanders in LevelPlanView.xaml, I'd like to have the buttons in the
  header. Research Attached Properties (local:Expander.HeaderCommands) and
  overriding the HeaderTemplate style, based on the Mahapps style.
* Need to be able to have features replace older versions of
  themselves. Alternatively, a way to remove features. Probably need the same
  thing when I get to spells, attacks, weapons, etc.
* Some info is only added when you first take a class. Extract that stuff into a
  class plan, and change the class field in the Level Plan UI to a combo box
  that pulls from that list. The ClassPlan class needs the following properties:
** Hit Dice
** Saving Throws
** Specialization (e.g. Druid Circle, Cleric Domain)
* Spells. While it's possible to find spell books, I think planning ahead for
  spell progression is the more common case, so it should be part of the level
  plan.

** link:./AdventurePlanner.UI/ViewModels/CharacterPlanViewModel.cs#L339[339] AddArmorPlanImpl, etc are small enough that they would probably better inline.
